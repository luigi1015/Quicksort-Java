Quicksort
=========

A small Java project to implement an in place version of Quicksort.

To use the code you need to use the quicksort function. The function takes three parameters, a List of items of class T, an int of the index of the leftmost element (usually 0), and the index of the rightmost element (usually the size of the array - 1).

Class T just needs to be a class that implements comparable.
